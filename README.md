# Kanye 2049 Tribute

A retro-futuristic tribute website inspired by [kanye2049.com](https://kanye2049.com/). This project recreates the experience of the original site, featuring a narrative about a leaked Kanye West album in a dystopian future setting.

## 🎵 Narrative

The project is set in the year 2049. Kanye West has been missing for almost 30 years, and global warming is threatening human civilization. In this setting, the president makes contact with an alternate, utopian Earth that solved its climate crisis. This alternate reality sends a gift: a leaked Kanye West album. The president believes this album might hold the key to saving our planet.

The website includes links to resources about climate change and organizations working to combat it, blending entertainment with environmental awareness.

## 🔧 Development

### Gulp Tasks

The project uses Gulp for build automation with the following tasks:

- **`styles`**: Compiles SCSS to minified CSS
- **`scripts`**: Minifies JavaScript files
- **`images`**: Copies and optimizes images
- **`html`**: Copies HTML files
- **`favicons`**: Copies favicon and related assets
- **`staticFiles`**: Copies static assets (fonts, sounds, videos)
- **`watch`**: Watches for file changes and triggers rebuilds
- **`build`**: Runs all build tasks in parallel

### Key Features Implementation

#### Boot Sequence
The site features an authentic BIOS-style boot sequence in `src/js/script.js`:
- Displays system information and copyright
- Shows quantum battery status and neural memory alignment
- Includes philosophical text about niniOS
- Transitions to login screen

#### Audio System
- Background ambient audio with loop functionality
- Media session integration for system controls
- Audio player with play/pause/stop controls
- iOS compatibility considerations

#### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach with SCSS mixins
- CRT effect toggle for retro aesthetic
- Flexible layout that adapts to screen sizes

## 🎨 Customization

### Styling
- Modify `src/scss/_variables.scss` for color schemes and typography
- Update `src/scss/_main.scss` for layout changes
- Add new SCSS files to `src/scss/` and import in `_main.scss`

### Content
- Edit `src/index.html` for main content
- Update boot sequence text in `src/js/script.js` (lines 40-50)
- Modify audio files in `src/sound/` directory

### Features
- Toggle CRT effect by modifying the `crtEffect` variable in `script.js`
- Adjust ambient sound settings in the `ambientSound` variable
- Customize share functionality in the `sharePopups` object

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `gulpfile.mjs` browserSync configuration
2. **Audio not playing**: Check browser autoplay policies and iOS restrictions
3. **Build errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `npm install`

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- iOS Safari with some audio limitations
- IE11 with polyfills included
