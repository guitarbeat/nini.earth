# Kanye 2049 Tribute

This project is a tribute to the website [kanye2049.com](https://kanye2049.com/). It recreates the experience of the original site, which features a narrative about a leaked Kanye West album in a dystopian future.

## Narrative

The project is set in the year 2049. Kanye West has been missing for almost 30 years. Global warming is threatening human civilization.

In this setting, the president makes contact with an alternate, utopian Earth that solved its climate crisis. This alternate reality sends a gift: a leaked Kanye West album. The president believes this album might hold the key to saving our planet. The website also includes links to resources about climate change and organizations working to combat it.

## Running the Project

This is a Node.js project built with Gulp.

**Prerequisites:**

*   Node.js and npm: You can download them from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

**Installation:**

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/guitarbeat/nini.earth.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd nini.earth
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

**Running the project:**

*   Use the following command to build and serve the website locally:
    ```bash
    npm run serve
    ```
    Alternatively, you can run Gulp directly:
    ```bash
    gulp
    ```
    This will usually open the site in your default web browser at an address like `http://localhost:3000`.

## Inspiration

This project is a fan-made tribute and is heavily inspired by the original [kanye2049.com](https://kanye2049.com/) website. Please check out the original site for the full experience!

## Project Structure

*   `src/`: Contains the source files for the website, including HTML, SCSS (Sass), JavaScript, images, and sound files.
*   `dist/`: Contains the built version of the website. These are the files that are served when you run the project. The contents of this directory are automatically generated by the build process.
